# Mason Money

Mason money is stable cryptocurrency built for everyone :heart:.

# Goals

  * Promote a positive culture around the currency based on optimism, empathy
    and open mindedness
  * Minimize (or eliminate) price volatility.
  * Minimize energy consumption required to keep the network secure
  * Create a payment process that is user friendly. (Payment addresses look like
    email addresses ie
    "mason$mason.money"
  * Make the best possible developer experience for interacting with the
    protocol
  * Keep the protocol and the implementation as simple as possible

# Currency Peg
The unit of currency transacted on the  Mason network is the Mason dollar. The value of a Mason dollar is [pegged](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed_exchange-rate_system) to the USD. Mason nodes track exchange rates and create new currency only when deemed necessary to maintain the peg.
